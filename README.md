Hi, I’m Aayush (aka neurobyte) 👋  
I'm a software developer exploring the overlap between AI, backend systems, and automation.

I enjoy building practical tools—things that solve real problems, not just look good on a resume.  
Most of my current work revolves around AI-powered products, scalable APIs, and developer utilities that align with what top tech companies are building.

## What I’m Currently Building

### 1. AI-Powered Resume Analyzer
Parse resumes → Analyze with NLP → Score and recommend improvements.  
Also matches resumes to job descriptions with % fit scoring.  
**Tech**: Python, Streamlit, OpenAI API, spaCy

### 2. E-Commerce Backend API
Modular, production-grade backend: auth, cart, orders, payments, Docker, and Swagger docs.  
**Tech**: Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Express

### 3. LeetCode Tracker
Track your problem-solving history, time spent, and topic-wise stats. Includes leaderboard and GitHub sync.  
**Tech**: MERN / Django + SQLite

### 4. AI Chatbot with Custom Dataset
Upload PDFs or datasets → Ask questions → Get accurate context-aware replies using GPT or local LLMs.  
**Tech**: Python, LangChain, Streamlit, ChromaDB

## Experimental Projects (Inspired by Big Tech Labs)

These are based on tools/ideas under development in leading companies, often not yet public:

### 5. Auto-Dev Copilot (Like Amazon CodeWhisperer)
An in-browser coding assistant that auto-suggests boilerplate code and completes functions based on context.  
**Tech**: TypeScript, Monaco Editor, GPT-4 API, Codex

### 6. Task-Aware AI Agent (Inspired by Microsoft's AutoGen)
An agent that auto-creates sub-agents for coding, testing, and documentation based on input.  
**Tech**: LangChain, Python, Multi-agent workflow, OpenAI Functions

### 7. Smart Interview Question Generator
Takes job description and resume → Generates company-specific technical + behavioral questions.  
**Tech**: Python, NLP, Prompt Engineering, Streamlit

### 8. Time-Tracking CLI Tool (Internal Tools Style)
A simple CLI app to log time, auto-summarize tasks, and generate reports. Think Linear × GitHub activity tracker.  
**Tech**: Go / Rust, SQLite, Git CLI APIs

### 9. Feedback-Driven UI Generator (Meta AI Internal Research)
Text → Working React components with minimal design + logic based on user intent.  
**Tech**: LLMs + TailwindCSS + React + Framer Motion

### 10. Voice-Based Code Navigator (Experimental Dev Tool)
Navigate your codebase using voice commands like “jump to function X” or “search error logs”.  
**Tech**: Electron + Whisper ASR + Tree-sitter
