Hi there, I’m Aayush (aka neurobyte).  
I’m a software developer exploring the edge of AI, backend engineering, and developer tooling.

I'm currently working on projects that combine real-world problem solving with technologies like NLP, LLMs, and scalable web infrastructure. I enjoy turning ideas into polished systems that are practical, usable, and built with care.

A modular backend system with full-stack features like Auth, Cart, Orders, and Payments. Dockerized, documented, and tested.  
**Stack**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis, Swagger, Docker

---

### 3. LeetCode Tracker  
Track your problem-solving on DSA platforms with time logs, tags, analytics, and GitHub integration.  
**Stack**: MERN / Django + SQLite

---

### 4. AI Chatbot with Custom Dataset  
Upload a PDF or custom dataset and ask context-based questions via GPT-powered chatbot.  
**Stack**: Python, LangChain, OpenAI, Streamlit

---

### 5. Auto Cover Letter Generator *(Inspired by Rezi.ai)*  
An LLM-powered tool that generates tailored cover letters for job applications using your resume + job description.

### 6. DevOps Feedback Dashboard *(Inspired by GitHub Copilot Metrics)*  
Visualize productivity and code quality feedback from your GitHub commits, PRs, and workflows using ML.  
**Stack**: Python, GitHub API, React, SQLite

---

### 7. Context-Aware Code Reviewer *(Inspired by Amazon CodeWhisperer)*  
Auto-analyze pull requests using LLMs to flag issues, suggest changes, and highlight logic inconsistencies.  
**Stack**: Node.js, GPT-4 API, GitHub Actions

---

### 8. Smart Meeting Notes + Action Items Extractor *(Inspired by Microsoft Copilot)*  
Drop a Zoom or Teams transcript and get summarized notes with decisions, next steps, and deadlines extracted.  
**Stack**: Python, NLTK, LangChain, Streamlit

---

### 9. AI-Powered Tech Blog Generator *(Inspired by OpenAI's use cases)*  
Convert a topic or paper into a clean, SEO-optimized blog post or explainer with citations and code examples.  
**Stack**: Python, GPT-4, Markdown, Flask

---

### 10. Instant REST API Generator from DB Schema *(Inspired by Supabase)*
