# neurobyte

Hi, Iâ€™m Aayush (aka neurobyte) ðŸ‘‹  
I'm a software developer exploring the overlap between AI, backend systems, and automation.

I enjoy building practical toolsâ€”things that solve real problems, not just look good on a resume.  
Most of my current work revolves around AI-powered products, scalable APIs, and developer utilities that align with what top tech companies are building.
